# What-if Analysis of Residential Real Estate in New Jersey

## Summary
The aim of the project is to examine the impact of 4 metrices viz. school rating, crime, mass transit and population affecting valuation of  residential real estate of New Jersey.

## Data Source
* School data: [Schooldigger](https://www.schooldigger.com/)
* Crime data: [NJ State Police](https://www.njsp.org/)
* Real-estate data: [NJMLS](https://www.newjerseymls.com/)
* Transit: [NJ Transit](https://www.njtransit.com/hp/hp_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=HomePageTo)
* Population: [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/)

## Methodology
![method](https://github.com/Harmeet2504/Project-What-if-analysis-of-residential-real-estate/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-22%20at%208.26.24%20AM.png)

For this data were retrieved from different sources: API calls were made to retrieve school data from schooldigger.com, crime records from NJSP.Gov, residential real estate data from newjerseymls.com, mass transit information from NJ Transit (API) and population of counties from United States Census Bureau.

Isolated data relevant for the project from each data source, cleaned and transformed each dataset. A master dataframe was created by merging all the data using pandas. Correlation between the metics were measured in terms of Pierson's Coefficient of correlation. Trend/ relationship was examined by generating regression equation from scatter plots. Percentage of population versus crime of each counties were compared by generating donut plots(variant of pie plot). Bins were created to designate areas with high , moderate, low crime rates.  School data per county was analysed by generating stacked bar plots. NJ transit map was generated using google map and markers were used for indicating each station.

Following are a few images from the analyses:

* School versus residential price

* Crime per county

* Crime rate versus school score

## Findings
* Counties with good schools have high residential valuation.
* Mass transit affects both residential price as well as crime of an area.
* No clear correlation was observed between crime and residential price as population of an area tend to affect the overall crime rate.
* There are many other factors that affect residential valuation which could not be covered in the project. Taking them into consideration and anlayzing them holistically will provide greater insights into the dynamics of residential property valuation.

## Challenges
* API call made to retrieve records from  multiple pages. For loops used to deal with pagination and data unpacking.
* One Station was tagged to multiple Stations. Had data for Light rails and path. Data was transfor,ed and cleaned to remove ambiguity
* No real estate data could be retrieved for south of New Jersey. Hence, the study is limited to observations from North Jersey.

## Installation packages and libraries used
Jupyter notebook, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy

## To run  
API keys will have to be obtained for google map and schooldigger
